| CARE                             | CARE                 | A often used abbreviation that stands for ***C**onnectivity*, ***A**dequacy*, ***R**epresentation*, and ***E**ffectiveness* which key principles that should be considered when designing a conservation network. See the [Marxan website](https://marxansolutions.org/the-care-principles/) for more information. |
| Conservation Prioritization      |                      | The computational process of identifying (spatial) priorities for a given conservation objective (such as for identifying protected areas). Usually comes in in the form of a map.                                                                                                                                 |
| Integer                          |                      | In programmatic terms a full number (e.g. -1, 1, 2, 3, ...)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Integer Linear Programming       | ILP                  | Mathematical problem formulation using Linear Programming (ILP) where the variables are integer values and the objective function and equations are linear.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Planning unit                    | PU                   | The fundamental unit at which decisions in SCP are realized. Can be of multiple formats such as grid cells or farms                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Systematic Conservation Planning | SCP                  | A framework and step-wise approach towards mapping conservation areas. Usually involves multiple steps such as the identification of a problem and the theory of change, data collection and preparation, conservation prioritization, evaluation and finally implementation.
