Whenever there are uncertainties with regards to definitions, see the ?sec-glossary.\nIf you have already heard before about the basic concepts of SCP and ILP (For example from the lecture then feel to jump to section 2 and data preparation 2  Preparing input data for a SCP project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you start…\n\n\n\nIn order to run the materials on this course website, some preparatory steps need to be taken. Please see the installation instructions in Appendix A — Installation of all software if you have never used prioritizr before!",

See the Marxan website for more information.\n\n\nConservation Prioritization\n\nThe computational process of identifying (spatial) priorities for a given conservation objective (such as for identifying protected areas). Usually comes in in the form of a map.\n\n\nInteger\n\nIn programmatic terms a full number (e.g. -1, 1, 2, 3, …)\n\n\nInteger Linear Programming\nILP\nMathematical problem formulation using Linear Programming (ILP) where the variables are integer values and the objective function and equations are linear.\n\n\nPlanning unit\nPU\nThe fundamental unit at which decisions in SCP are realized. Can be of multiple formats such as grid cells or farms\n\n\nSystematic Conservation Planning\nSCP\nA framework and step-wise approach towards mapping conservation areas. Usually involves multiple steps such as the identification of a problem and the theory of change, data collection and preparation, conservation prioritization, evaluation and finally implementation.
