    "text": "1.1 Systematic conservation planning\nThe classical definition of Systematic conservation planning (SCP) is that of a structured, scientific approach to identifying and prioritizing areas for conservation (REFs). Its goal is to ensure that biodiversity is maintained and ecosystems are protected in a way that maximizes ecological, economic, and social benefits. Although SCP has been conceived specifically for creating and expanding reserve networks (usually protected areas), it can be used for much more including for example the identification of restoration, land-use planning or monitoring options.\nIt is also a common misconception that a project implementing SCP is only about prioritization (the algorithm part). Rather, it describes a whole framework typically ranging from",

Solvers are specialized algorithms or software designed to find the best solution (or an optimal solution) to a mathematical problem that involves maximizing or minimizing a particular function subject to certain constraints. For different mathematical problems, for example linear or mixed programming, different solvers are often necessary or perform better.\nMany state-of-the-art solvers are proprietary and often used by large companies to solve problems related to supply chain or financial risk managements. Although freely available and open-source solver slowly catch up, they usually cannot compete with proprietary such as Gurobi or CPLEX. For a comprehensive overview of different available and supported solvers a detailed vignette can be found on the prioritizr website.\nFor new users we recommend the use of the HiGHS solver, which is free to use and can be installed across a range of operating systems. To enable it run the following code and make sure it runs through without issues.\n\ninstall.packages(\"highs\")\n\nIf for some reason the installation of he package fails, another option could be the cbc solver, which can currently only be installed directly from the developers Github repository. For this to work you likely need to have RTools installed (see A.1 above).\n\nif (!require(remotes)) install.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"dirkschumacher/rcbc\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGurobi\n\n\n\nThe Gurobi solver is among the fastest supported ones for prioritizr. Unfortunately it is not openly available and purchasing it can be quite costly. However for academic users (those with an academic email) and researchers it is possible to obtain a time-limited (usually 12 months) license for research projects. This License can also be renewed.\nFor further information see the installation vignette on the prioritizr homepage!",
