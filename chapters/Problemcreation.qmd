# Create basic problem

Create and solve a problem that finds the best areas for 30% protected area coverage on European land:

```{r, eval = F}
# define area budget (unit: grid cells)
budget.area <- round(0.3 * length(cells(PU))) 

p <- problem(PU, spp)%>%
  add_min_shortfall_objective(budget = budget.area)%>%
  add_relative_targets(targets = 1) %>%  
  # <1> 
  add_cbc_solver()%>% 
  # <2> 
  add_proportion_decisions()
  # <3>

```

1.  target is 100% for all species distributions.
2.  CBC has the best performance across open solvers.
3.  proportional decisions means that proportions of planning units can be selected in the solution. This typically solve faster and better than binary decisions.
