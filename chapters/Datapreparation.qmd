# Preparing input data {#sec-dataprep}

## Planning units

Planning units (PU) contains the spatial data of the study area. Here, we use raster format. The planning units are 10x10 km grid cells in Europe.

Let's read the planning units data.

```{r, eval = F}

rast("data/PlanningUnits.tif")

```

## Features

Explain what features are and plot

## Costs

Explain what costs are and how they are used

## Other constraints (Protected areas)

Showcase a protected area file and exclusion areas as example

## Other data for the prioritization

Mention weights, targets, etc and give example for each

## Preparing data in different formats

Showcase different dataformats as input alternative

``` r
library(tidyverse)
trees |>                                         # <1>
  mutate(                                        
  volume_girth = volume * girth                  # <2>
  )                                              
```

1.  Take dataset and mutate
2.  Update with interaction term
