Date: 6 June 2024
Author: Louise O'Connor 

This folder contains: 
1) Species Distributions: 
- species distributions modelled under current and future (rcp 8.5) climate for 67 tree species. SDM were built by Thiago Cavalcante. 
Note: all spatial raster data is at 10x10 km resolution and harmonized spatially.  

2) other data: 
- planning units raster
- NDVI : proxy for dense and healthy vegetation cover. Data extracted and prepared for Europe by Thiago Cavalcante. 
- ghm: global human modification index. Data extracted and prepared for Europe by Thiago Cavalcante. For further details on the species distributions, NDVI and GHM layers, see https://github.com/zonationteam/Zonation5-training/tree/main/2024%20Europe/Exercises/data
- urban_prct and HI_forest_prct.tif : percentage coverage per 10x10 grid cell of urban/periurban, and high-intensity forests, respectively. Aggregated to 10x10k from  European land systems dataset by Dou et al ., 2021, originally at 1km resolution. 
- protectedareas.tif : all protected areas for the study area from WDPA
- protectedareas_I_II.tif : strictly protected areas (IUCN categories I and II) for the study area from WDPA
- species_red_list.csv : global and European assessment of conservation status of these 67 species 

The R script prep_data.R cleans and prepares this data.
